# Formulas and Functions in Excel

## Why They Matter
Formulas and functions are the core of Excel.
They turn Excel from a data table into a calculation tool.

---

## 1. Formula

- A formula is created by you.
- You define the calculation manually.
- Uses cell references and operators.
- Must always start with an equal sign (=).

### Operators
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

### Examples
- =A1 + B1  
- =(A1*10)/2

## 2. Function

- A function is a pre-defined formula built into Excel.
- Excel provides 461+ functions.
- Used to save time and reduce manual work.
- Best for large ranges and repeated calculations.

### Example
- =SUM(A1:A100)

## 3. Parts of a Function

Every function follows a fixed structure.

1. Equal sign (=)  
   Starts the calculation.
2. Function name  
   Defines the operation.
3. Arguments  
   Data or cell ranges inside parentheses.

### Example
- =SUM(A1:B10)  
  A1:B10 is the argument.

## 4. Formula vs Function Comparison

| Example | Type | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| =B5 * C5 | Formula | Manual use of operators |
| =MAX(D1:D50) | Function | Uses a built-in Excel function |
| =SUM(A1:A10) / 10 | Both | Formula containing a function |

## 5. Formulas Tab Overview

- Function Library  
  Functions grouped by category.
- Defined Names  
  Assign names to ranges for readability.
- Formula Auditing  
  Trace Precedents shows data sources.  
  Show Formulas displays formulas instead of results.
- Calculation Options  
  Control automatic or manual calculation.

## Student Summary

- Use formulas for simple, custom calculations.
- Use functions for complex tasks and large data ranges.
- A single formula can include one or more functions.
