# Module 6 – Creating a Sample Workbook  
## Monthly Budget Spreadsheet – Professional Notes

## Workbook Setup

- Create a new Excel workbook.
- Save the file as Monthly_Budget.xlsx.
- Treat one workbook as one complete project.

## Budget Sheet Structure

- Use a single worksheet.
- Define clear column headers:
  - Date
  - Description
  - Category
  - Payment Mode
  - Amount
  - Type
- Headers establish data meaning and consistency.

## Cell Navigation

- Tab moves the active cell to the right.
- Enter moves the active cell downward.
- Keyboard navigation improves speed and control during data entry.

---

## Column Width Management

- AutoFit columns based on content.
- Adjust widths manually when required.
- Text columns need more width than numeric columns.
- Proper width improves readability.

## Number Alignment Rules

- Text aligns to the left by default.
- Numbers align to the right.
- Dates align to the right.
- Alignment acts as a quick data-type check.

## Date Formatting

### Built-in Formats
- Apply standard date formats using Format Cells.
- Formatting changes appearance, not stored value.

### Custom Formats
- Use custom patterns such as:
  - dd-mm-yyyy
  - mmm-yyyy
- Custom formats support reporting and summaries.

## Cell Selection Techniques

### Continuous Selection
- Select adjacent cells using Shift.
- Used for formatting ranges or applying formulas.

### Non-Continuous Selection
- Select separated cells using Ctrl.
- Used for selective formatting or edits.

---

## Review and Validation

- Scan the worksheet for alignment issues.
- Verify column widths and date formats.
- Ensure consistency across all rows.
