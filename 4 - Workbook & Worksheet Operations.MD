## 1. Sheet Management & Organization

Efficient sheet management transforms a cluttered file into a professional data system.

* **Add Sheet (`+` icon):** Keeps different data categories (e.g., Sales vs. Expenses) in one file.
* **Rename (Double-click tab):** Provides instant identification. *(e.g., "Jan_Report" instead of "Sheet1")*
* **Tab Color (Right-click tab):** Allows for visual coding. *(e.g., Green for "Paid," Red for "Overdue")*

## 2. Capacity & Scale Limits

Understanding the boundaries of your "canvas" is essential for handling big data.

* **Max Sheets (255):** Limit for a single workbook (memory dependent). Keeps files manageable.
* **Max Rows ():** The vertical limit.
* **Max Columns ( / Column XFD):** The horizontal limit.

## Summary: Why This Matters

* **Integrity:** `Ctrl` + `Arrows` helps you spot "gaps" (blank rows) that break formulas.
* **Efficiency:** Eliminates manual scrolling, saving hours of work over time.
* **Clarity:** Tab names and colors allow teammates to understand your logic without an explanation.
