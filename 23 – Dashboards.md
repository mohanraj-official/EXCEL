## What to Include vs Exclude

### Include

* KPI Cards with key numbers like Revenue and Profit
* Slicers for interactivity

* Clear, direct chart titles

### Exclude

* Too many colors. Limit to 2–3
* Worksheet gridlines
* 3D charts
* Raw data tables on the dashboard

## Chart Count Rule

Limit to 3–5 visual elements per screen.

Typical structure:

* 1 Trend chart. Line
* 1 Comparison chart. Bar or Column
* 1 Composition chart. Donut or Treemap
* 2–3 KPI Cards

### Step 5: Assembly

* Cut charts from Calculations sheet
* Paste them into the Dashboard sheet
* Align them neatly

### Step 6: Remote Control

* Insert Slicers from PivotChart Analyze
* Use slicers for Time and Category
